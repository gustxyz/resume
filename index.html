										<h4>Frontend Developer (Freelance Contract)</h4>
										<h5>Nov 2021 - Present (4+ months)</h5>
										
										<p>
											My first freelancing project was in conjunction with Harmonic Northwest to build a serverless shopify store with custom branding for pool supply company in arizona called Shasta Pools
											
											<br> <br> Shasta was built statically using Next.js to pre-render over 200 product pages pulling directly from shopify's headless graphql api, 
											and then serve them via a CDN as a static react bundle.
											
											<br> <br>This setup allowed us complete freedom to design the site without being constrained by Shopify's template system -- the static nature of the site made it secure and scalable by default.
										
											
											<br> <br>What I really loved about the Shasta project was being able to showcase things like search and customer checkout in a serverless environment.

												<h5>Built for Harmonic Northwest</h5>

													Built a custom static e-commerce store using React and Shopify headless. Implemented search, used Next.js to generate static pages for over 200 products, and built the UI from scratch using css modules. Because of it's static nature, the site can be served with a CDN making it highly scalable and secure given that there is no server to rely on.
